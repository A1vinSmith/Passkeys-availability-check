# Tips
You can save multiple passkeys for different platforms using various tools. For example, I use BitWarden, ProtonPass, and the built-in Apple feature. 

On mobile, iOS will prompt you to choose which one you want to use each time. 

On a desktop browser, the Bitwarden popup appears first; close it, then the ProtonPass popup appears, and finally, the Apple passkey prompt appears last.

# TO-DO
1. Sort them alphabetically
